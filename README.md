# OldProjects

A collection of code I wrote between the years 2013 and 2016.

I'm putting this code up here because I think it's a cool way to perserve where I came from. I
captured these files from a harddrive from my old Acer Laptop. These were all micro projects
I worked on to try and understand the art of programming.

## Warning:

**Prepare for some ugly code!** I understood the `switch` construct in C before I understood `if`. Therefore, 
you may convulse at the sight of my own code. Do know that I write better code now and that I feel
10x worse knowing that at one point, some of this code seemed absolutely genius to me.
